          <p class="img">
            Death may strike anyone prematurely. When death takes the life of a
            family provider, surviving family members often suffer if they are
            left without adequate income or the means to provide even basic
            necessities. Life insurance creates an instant estate, regardless of
            when death occurs.
            <br /><br />
            However, some people face the unpleasant prospect of outliving their
            income. Retirement may be forced upon them before they have
            adequately prepared for a non-income earning existence. Sickness and
            disability can also leave economic scars, often more intense than
            death.
          </p>

            Insurance evolved to produce a practical solution to economic
            uncertainties and losses.
            <u
              >The primary reason for purchasing life insurance is to provide
              death benefits and create an estate.</u
            >
            Health insurance also evolved from scientific principles to provide
            funds for medical expenses due to sickness or injury and to cover
            loss of income during a disability. Annuities provide income by
            making a series of payments to the annuitant for a specific period
            of time or for life.
