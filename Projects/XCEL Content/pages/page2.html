						<br><br>
						There are many ways to classify organizations that provide insurance such as where the company is located, how the company is owned, or with the company is authorized in a given state. In the broadest of terms, insurance companies are typically classified as: private/commercial and government. Within these two classes are many categories of insurance providers as well as insurance plans and insurance producers. It's important to note that the company providing the insurance is called the insur<b>er</b>. The covered person is known as the insur<b>ed</b>.
						<br><br>
						<strong style="color:#9A1B1E">Private or Commercial Insurance Companies</strong>
						<br><br>
						Commercial insurers are private companies offering many lines of insurance. Some sell primarily life insurance and annuities, while others sell primarily accident and health insurance, or primarily property and casualty insurance. <u>Companies that sell more than one line of insurance are known as <strong style="color:#9A1B1E">multi-line insurers</strong></u>. If a company only sells one line of insurance there are a mono-line insurer. Stock and mutual companies are can both be considered commercial insurers, and as such both can write life, health, property, and casualty insurance.
						<br><br>
						<strong style="color:#9A1B1E">Stock Companies - Nonparticipating</strong>
						<br><br>
						A stock insurance company is a private organization, organized and incorporated under state laws for the purpose of making a profit for its stockholders (shareholders). It is structured the same as any corporation.  Stockholders may or may not be policyholders. When declared, stock dividends are paid to stockholders. In a stock company, the directors and officers are responsible to the stockholders. <em style="color:#9A1B1E">A stock company is referred to as a nonparticipating company because policyholders do not participate in dividends resulting from stock ownership.</em> As opposed to passing a savings on to policy holders, stock companies look to grow their <strong>earned surplus</strong> or post-tax earnings not paid in dividends. Earnings retained by a company are considered equity and as such are owned by the shareholders.
