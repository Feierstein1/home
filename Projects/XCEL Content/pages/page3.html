            Mutual insurance companies are also organized and incorporated under
            state laws, but they have no stockholders. Instead, the owners are
            the policyholders. Anyone purchasing insurance from a mutual insurer
            is both a customer and an owner. He has the right to
            <u style="color: #9a1b1e;"
              >vote for members of the board of directors. Mutual companies are
              referred to as participating companies because the policyowners
              participate in dividends.</u

            By issuing participating policies that pay policy dividends, mutual
            insurers allow their policyowners to share in any company earnings
            (divisible surplus).
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Divisible surplus</strong> is the amount of earnings paid to
            policyowners as dividends after the insurance company sets aside
            funds required to cover reserves, operating expenses, and general
            business purposes. Essentially, policy dividends represent a refund
            of the portion of premium that remains after the company has set
            aside the necessary reserves and has made deductions for claims and
            expenses. Policy dividends can also include a share in the company's
            investment, mortality, and operating profits. Surpluses are
            typically distributed to policyowners on an annual basis.
            <br /><br />
            Occasionally, a stock company may be converted into a mutual company
            through a process called <strong>mutualization</strong>. Likewise,
            mutuals can convert to stock companies through a process called
            <strong>demutualization</strong>. In the rare case of a stock
            insurance company issuing both participating and nonparticipating
            policies, the company is referred to as using a mixed plan.

            <strong>Participating</strong> policies allow policyholders to
            <strong>participate</strong> in the company by by electing the board
            of directors and receiving dividends from the divisible surplus.
            <strong>Non-participating</strong> policies to not allow to
            policyholders to participate in elections or dividends and instead
            aim to increase profit for the shareholders.
