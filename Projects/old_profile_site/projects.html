							I developed and maintained a reporting system for our clients to recieve daily reports
							on their students online course progress. We used (third party) Absorb LMS to host classes for students, 
							but were limited on how we could create reports for every client based on their needs. To fix this issue, I 
							had a CSV file of all our students information FTP'd every morning to our personal server 
							where a cron job was set up to run PHP script that would store all our student information along 
							with the clients recipient information in a MySQL database. Once this was done, another script would run that
							would parse through the client information and collect the appropriate student information and format it in 
							a clean HTML table. This table was placed in an email and sent to the client via PHPMailer.

							I used Absorb LMS RESTful API to build tools in our course content to meet state regulations. I created content that 
							would timeout due to inactivity, show students time spent within the course, save student session time when active in a session,
							promps that would ask students to securley indentify themselves, and prevent multiple sessions of a course to be opened.

							I created online affidavit forms that would ask for student information and confirm their

							custom fileds on Absorb LMS and also stored student information on private servers to meet state requirements.

							I created a tool used in office using RESTful API that would search through all attempts made by students and 
							notify the office staff members if any students had breach their state regulatory requirements for session time spent.
							This was initaially done manually and would take hours to get through a small list of students.
